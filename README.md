### Additional Info
Website was made as part of a project-based Udemy class: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/">Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3</a>.
Class mainly dealt with front-end programming (html, css, jquery, etc) and was a good project-oriented intro course into web development.
